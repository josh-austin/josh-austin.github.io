    <p>First of all, I would like to say a THANK YOU to all the people in the service of
our country who have worked hard to protect us.  My thoughts and prayers have
been with you this day.</p>

<p>I know that these days have been discouraging to many political
conservatives because of the ill-considered and, at times, immoral decisions
made by our country’s leadership.  This makes many of us understandably want
to do something about it.  There are three things you can do about it today:</p>

<h3 id="love-god">1.  Love God</h3>
<p>Are we letting ourselves lose focus on who is the most important Person in our lives?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[And] you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.<br />
<em>Deutoronomy 6:5 &amp; Mark 12:30, ESV</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="love-others">2.  Love Others</h3>
<p>Are we letting ourselves focus so much on ourselves that we lose focus on the needs of others?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.”<br />
<em>Luke 10:27, ESV</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.<br />
<em>Philippians 2:3, ESV</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But if anyone has the world’s goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God’s love abide in him?<br />
<em>1 John 3:17, ESV</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="keep-praying">3.  Keep Praying!</h3>
<p>The Lord can change those who oppose what is good.  He changed a vehement anti-Christian activist into an apostle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.  Now as he went on his way, he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him. 4 And falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”  And he said, “Who are you, Lord?” And he said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.<br />
<em>Acts 9:1-5, ESV</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, “He is the Son of God.”  And all who heard him were amazed and said, “Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name? And has he not come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests?”  But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.<br />
<em>Acts 9:20-22, ESV</em></p>
</blockquote>
